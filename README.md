My First HTML / CSS Personal Blog

Hello friends, I want to learn HTML/CSS and PHP, then I want to be a Computer Engineer and I started learning a new language.
This is my first HTML/CSS personal blog page. I hope you like my page for codes and also for design. I'm not here for 50 days because
I have a university exam. I will share my page here because this platform is very useful. I'll be very happy if you give me a hint
thank you all.
